# Streaming data from a LEGO Truck 🚚

Using data streamed from our custom made LEGO Truck,
we will present several Scala-based streaming event processing technologies
such as Apache Kafka (Kafka Streams), Apache Storm
and Apache Spark (Spark Streaming).

We will show key differences and we will try to compare them in a fair manner
on aspects like performance, implementation learning curve, stability, etc.
