# Streaming data from a LEGO Truck ðŸšš

Using data streamed from our custom made LEGO Truck,
we will present several Scala-based streaming technologies
such as Apache Kafka (Kafka Streams), Apache Storm
and Apache Spark (Spark Streaming).

We will show key differences and we will try to compare them in a fair manner
on aspects like performance, implementation learning curve, stability, etc.
